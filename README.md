 - An RS TV Show Tracker web implementation

 - Episode Calendar (A RS TV Show Tracker but for web)

**This project is ment as an personal episode calendar and not as the rest of them out there that is for multiple users Really the only difference from the Epi calendars like episodecalendar.com is going to be that this has absolutly no reg required, simply add series and go (just as in RS TV Show Tracker).
  
* Index.php:
("Home" or "Overview", shows all the listed shows, latest episodes and the upcoming episode (if show has ended it will show that). Each table is able to be sorted by a -z, z - a (Show list) )
